# Flinkctl
Flinkctl is a simple CLI written on Go using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) created to facilitate my team's daily basis work with multiple Flink clusters at [Azion Technologies](https://www.azion.com/). Bare metal, VMs, and Kubernetes clusters, we have it all, this tool knows how to work with Flink REST API and do complex tasks on any of them. It is also used as an interface between other apps and CD pipelines.
